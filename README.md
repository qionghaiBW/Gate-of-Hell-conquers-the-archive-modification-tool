The V0.1 version released last time had too few functions. After receiving suggestions from group and forum friends, I spent one and a half days rewriting a new V0.2 version yesterday and today.
This tool is written in Python. The original intention was just to make it convenient for newbies (roommates) who really couldn't understand the modification tutorial or wanted to save time to modify their Conquest save files. I used AI to generate the basic graphical structure, and I was only responsible for adding correction codes, arguing with AI, compiling and packaging, local testing, and other useless work... I only did simple tests on my own and my roommate's computers, and the software can run normally;
Please back up your save files in time! Please back up your save files in time! Please back up your save files in time! The new version of the tool provides a backup option.
The following is the usage instructions
